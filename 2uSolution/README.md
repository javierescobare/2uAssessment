# 2uSolution

Entire solution to solve both user stories of the assessment.

### Known issues

-   There might be problems when inserting 2 or more invoices with the same invoice number. It would be better to generate the _invoice_number_ from the API rather than requesting it in the body of the HTTP POST.

-   A loading indicator in the React app would be appreciated.

-   Swagger docs should be removed for a production environment.
